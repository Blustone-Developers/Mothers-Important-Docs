## Information
Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the application Mother Fox (the "Service") operated by Blustone Developers ("us", "we", or "our").
Acceptance and compliance with these Terms are required before you may access or use the Service. All visitors, users, and others wishing to access or use the Service are subject to these Terms.
You agree to be bound by these Terms by accessing or using the Service. You will not have the authorisation to use the Service if you disagree with any element of the terms.

## Links To Other Web Sites
Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that Blustone Developers does not own or control. Blustone Developers has no control over and takes no responsibility for any third-party websites or services, including their content, privacy policies, or practices.
We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites. You acknowledge and agree that Blustone Developers shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such third-party web sites or services.
We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services you visit. We, therefore, reserve the right to change or update information and correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions without prior notice.

## Termination
We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.
All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

## Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Blustone Developers and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of either your use and access of the Service, or a breach of these Terms.

## Disclaimer
Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.
Blustone Developers, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and licensors make no warranty that:
   * The Service will function uninterrupted, secure, or available at any particular time or location
   * Any errors or defects will be corrected
   * The Service is free of viruses or other harmful components
   * The results of using the Service will meet your expectations.

## Exclusions
The restrictions above may not apply to you because some countries do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of responsibility for consequential or incidental damages.

## Governing Law
These Terms will be interpreted and governed by the laws of Australia without respect to its conflict of laws provisions.
Our failure to enforce any of the rights or conditions of these Terms will not be interpreted as a waiver of such rights. If any conditions of these Terms are found to be unconstitutional or unenforceable by a court, the other sections will remain in effect. These Terms contain our whole agreement concerning our Service. They supersede and replace any prior agreements we may have had.

## Changes
We retain the right to change or update these Terms at any time in our sole discretion. If the adjustment is significant, we shall provide you with at least 30 days' notice before the new terms take effect. We shall decide what constitutes a substantial change at our sole discretion.
You agree to be bound by the amended terms if you continue to use our Service after such adjustments become effective. You are not permitted to use the Service if you choose not to agree to the revised conditions.
