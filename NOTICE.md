## Information
The Service known as Mother Fox will be going under important maintenance. Due to our service needing to go under a verification check by [Discord](https://discord.com). Mothers' current status needs to be changed. Please read through the pointed areas below.


## The Changes
Mother Fox was developed with love for all people using [Discord](https://discord.com) and we wish to continue that ideal. Before Mother Fox can be verified, we have to undergo much needed maintenance. The changes that are planned to be undertaken are as follows:

 - Hosting 
 
   > Currently Mother Fox is hosted on a unreliable platform, which can lead to Mother Fox turning off for a rather long time. This has been a issue in the works for a while. The Blustone developers work on free applications for the community, so it does come out of our own pocket. We will be choosing a more reliable platform that we can trust to maintain Mother Fox's good reputation.

 - Music
 
   > Mothers' Music is a good area that everyone loves about Mother Fox. We regretfully inform you that due to [Discord](https://discord.com) TOS. We will be forced to remove it. All in all, this is a work in progress. We hope to bring music back in the future if we can get support from big companies.
 
 - Currency System

   > The current system has been locked to the main server, Hatake Blustone. Our current objective is to remove the bugs that have occurred in massive amounts. This may be a scrapped idea and removed entirely; we are currently unsure of the plans.
 
 - Mothers Docs
 
   > At the moment, Mother's important documents also need updating. Our TOS, privacy policy, and licence stay the same. Mother's Documentation, or what is otherwise known as her "manual," will also undergo maintenance.
 
 - Mothers Messages
 
    > Mother's responses to "hello" and "love you." Maybe removed because of the verification from [Discord](https://discord.com). We will fight for Mother to interact with her children a lot more. We are currently working on an AI so she can respond to you like any other Discord user.
 
 - Secret Changes
    
    > We will be adding new changes to Mother Fox that are unreleased in the coming future. *Note* Mother Fox will have Easter eggs added to her everyday commands. Look out for those!


## Online Status
Mother Fox will remain online but cannot be added to new servers. She will be removed from Top.gg until maintenance is complete. Her invitation command will only bring you here.

## Your Data
Your current data will still remain on Mother unless you decide otherwise. When Mother is finished with maintenance, all data will be erased. This will mean you have a clean slate and can return to getting those Fox Coins!

## Any Payment
I don't know why you're looking here Mother Fox is a free platform.
