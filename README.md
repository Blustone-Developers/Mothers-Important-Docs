### Common Questions
#### Will Mother Fox be open source?
* **Mother Fox should be and only be the only mother you need so it is been decided that Mother Fox will be a closed source. Meaning you cannot take a little peek at mothers code ~ Jamie**

#### Can you teach others to code?
* **Due to most of Blustone Devlepors Lifestyles all of us are either in our Final year or are in University. This leaves very little time to teach others to code, But we are always happy to help/Talk ~ Blustone Developers**

#### Can I help test Mother's Beta Features?
* **Yes, we love seeing people get involved with mother more! Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Cv47ehMhWW) we post updates in   `ðŸ¦Šâ”‚mother-fox-updates` ~ Jamie**
